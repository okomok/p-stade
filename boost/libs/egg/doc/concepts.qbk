[section Pipable Function Object]

[heading Description]
A __PIPABLE_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ is a __FUNCTION_OBJECT__ which behaves as if it were a "pipe" using `operator|` and `operator|=`.

[heading Refinement of]
* __FUNCTION_OBJECT__

[heading Requirements]
In addition to the requirements defined in the refinements,
for any __PIPABLE_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ `p` the following must be met:

* `x|p(x1,...,xN)` is a valid expresion if and only if `p(x1,...,xN)|=x` is a valid expression.
* `x|p(x1,...,xN)` and `p(x1,...,xN)|=x` have the same effects.
* If `N` is `0`, then `x|p()`, `x|p`, `p|=x`, and `p()|=x` are valid expressions which have the same effects.
* `operator|` works with left-to-right associativity.
* `operator|=` works with right-to-left associativity.

[note A __PIPABLE_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ can be overloaded with different arities, whereas __AMBI_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ cannot.]

[section Major Function Object]

[heading Description]
A __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ is a __POLYMORPHIC_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ which can be used with __BOOST_LAMBDA__.
Egg is a library which helps you define your own __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__.

In addition to the requirements defined in the refinements,
for any __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ `f` the following must be met:

* `f` can be used as the first argument of `boost::lambda::bind`.

[tip This concept can be implemented without depending on __BOOST_LAMBDA__ library. ]

[section Major Function Builder]

[heading Description]
A __MAJOR_FUNCTION_BUILDER__ is a __METAFUNCTION__ which returns a POD __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ type.

* __METAFUNCTION__

[heading Notation]
* `TOUPPER(x)` is a token that `x` is converted to uppercase.

[heading Requirements]
In addition to the requirements defined in the refinements,
for any __POD_FUNCTION_BUILDER__ `x` the following must be met:

* `x<A1,...,AN>::type` is a POD __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ type.
* `x<A1,...,AN>::type` is __DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTIBLE__ and __ASSIGNABLE__.
* `BOOST_EGG_##TOUPPER(x)()` is a (possibly braced) initializer to initialize `x<A1,...,AN>::type` object.
* Non-local object `x<A1,...,AN>::type` with /static storage duration/ is /statically initialized/ if initialized using `BOOST_EGG_##TOUPPER(x)()`.

[section Static Function Object]

[heading Description]
A __STATIC_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ is a __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ which is intended to replace normal functions.

[heading Refinement of]

* __MAJOR_FUNCTION_OBJECT__

[heading Requirements]
In addition to the requirements defined in the refinements,
for any __STATIC_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ `f` the following must be met:

* `_typeof(f)` is a /POD/ type in C++03 (a /trivial/ type in C++0x).
* `_typeof(f)` is __DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTIBLE__ and __ASSIGNABLE__.
* `f` is /statically initialized/.
* `boost::remove_reference<_decltype(f)>::type` is `_typeof(f) const`.
* If `boost::result_of<_typeof(f) const(a1,...,aN)>::type` is a valid expression,
  `boost::result_of<_typeof(f)(a1,...,aN)>::type` is a valid expression which is the same type.

[section Little Function]

[heading Description]
A __LITTLE_FUNCTION__ type is a type which __EGG_FUNCTION_BUILDERS__ require.

[heading Refinement of]

[heading Requirements]
In addition to the requirements defined in the refinements,
for any __LITTLE_FUNCTION__ type `L` the following must be met:

* `L` has a nested class template named `apply`, where `apply<...>::type` means return type of function calls.
* `L` has a const /member function/ named `call` whose return type is explicitly specified by the first template parameter.

[caution __BOOST_RESULT_OF__ document in boost.org is outdated.]

[heading How to call]

If you pass an lvalue argument, it must be a /reference type/; It can't be a /reference type/, otherwise:
[code_result_of_tutorial1]

Thanks to these two convention, you can easily write a "chain" of __BOOST_RESULT_OF__:
[code_result_of_tutorial2]

A /callable type/ can't be a /reference type/ but must be "const-correct",
meaning that you must add `const` to /const-qualified/ __FUNCTION_OBJECT__ type:
[code_result_of_tutorial3]

However, if a library guarantees the same behavior between /const-qualified/ type and
non-/const-qualified/ type (as __STATIC_FUNCTION_OBJECT__ does so), you could omit `const`:
[code_result_of_tutorial4]

[heading Bugs]

* msvc-7.1 and msvc-8.0 doesn't work with /POD/ templates.
* A /const-qualified/ function pointer doesn't work.

These bugs can be worked around by `egg::result_of` in `<boost/egg/result_of.hpp>`.
The first bug is fixed with Boost1.35.
